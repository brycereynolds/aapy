## Installation

### Setting up with pyenv (recommended)

1. **Install pyenv** if you don't have it already:

   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install pyenv
   
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   curl https://pyenv.run | bash
   ```

2. **Configure your shell** by adding the following to your profile file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
   eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   ```

3. **Install Python** with pyenv:

   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.11.0  # or any other version 3.8+
   ```

4. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd path/to/annas-downloader
   
   # Create a virtual environment
   pyenv local 3.11.0
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Set up authentication**:

   ```bash
   # Copy the example .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit the .env file with your Anna's Archive account ID
   # You can find this by logging into Anna's Archive and checking your cookies
   # Look for the "aa_account_id2" cookie value
   ```

## Usage

### Operation Modes

The script supports three primary modes of operation:

#### 1. Single Mode

Search for a book with a specific query and download it:

```bash
python aapy.py single "Project Hail Mary" --output books/
```

You can also search by ISBN:

```bash
python aapy.py single "9781250881205"
```

#### 2. Interactive Mode

Start an interactive session for multiple searches and downloads:

```bash
python aapy.py interactive
```

This mode allows you to:
- Enter multiple search queries (one at a time)
- Select from all available formats for each book
- Cancel any download at any point

#### 3. Debug Mode

Search for books without downloading them (useful for testing and troubleshooting):

```bash
python aapy.py debug "Foundation Asimov"
```

### Selection Menu

All modes present an interactive selection menu that shows:
- Book title and author
- Format information (EPUB ðŸ“™, PDF ðŸ“‘, MOBI ðŸ“•)
- File size when available
- Option to cancel the download

This allows you to make an informed choice even when only one result is found.

### Format Customization

You can now specify which formats you want to search for and download using the `--formats` option:

```bash
# Only search for and download EPUBs
python aapy.py single "Project Hail Mary" --formats epub

# Prioritize PDF over EPUB (order matters)
python aapy.py interactive --formats pdf,epub,mobi

# Include additional formats like FB2
python aapy.py interactive --formats epub,pdf,mobi,fb2
```

Available formats:
- `epub` - EPUB format (default priority: highest)
- `pdf` - PDF format (default priority: medium)
- `mobi` - MOBI format (default priority: low)
- `fb2` - FB2 format (disabled by default)
- `cbr` - CBR format (disabled by default)

The order you specify formats determines their priority in search results.

### Command Line Options

```
usage: aapy.py {single,interactive,debug} [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--verbose] [--formats FORMATS]

Download books from Anna's Archive by search query

modes:
  single               Download a book by search query (title, author, ISBN, etc)
  interactive          Run in interactive mode to download multiple books
  debug                Debug search results without downloading

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        Directory to save downloaded books (overrides OUTPUT_DIR in .env)
  --verbose, -v         Enable verbose logging
  --formats FORMATS, -f FORMATS
                        Comma-separated list of enabled formats (e.g., "epub,pdf,mobi")
```

### Authentication

Authentication is handled via the `.env` file, which should contain your Anna's Archive account ID:

```
AA_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here
OUTPUT_DIR=books/
```

To find your account ID:
1. Log in to Anna's Archive in your browser
2. Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
3. Go to the Storage or Application tab (depends on browser)
4. Look for Cookies â†’ annas-archive.org
5. Find the cookie named `aa_account_id2` and copy its value
6. Paste this value in your `.env` file

## How It Works

1. **Search Phase**: Searches Anna's Archive with specific parameters to find books matching your query
2. **Selection Phase**: Presents an interactive menu of all matching books with format details
3. **Download Phase**: Finds the fastest download link and saves the book file

## Format Prioritization System

The script now uses a dedicated configuration system for handling file formats:

- Each format has metadata including priority, icon, extension, and display name
- Formats are prioritized based on their assigned priority values
- Results are sorted by priority, so preferred formats appear first
- You can customize which formats are enabled and their priorities via command line

## Notes

- The script will only search for and download books available through Anna's Archive directly (not external sources)
- By default, it prioritizes EPUB format, then PDF, then MOBI
- Search parameters are customizable by modifying the `DEFAULT_SEARCH_PARAMS` dictionary in the script
- Downloaded books are saved to the "books/" directory by default (configurable in .env)

## Quick Start

For convenience, a `start.sh` script is included to quickly start the interactive mode:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x start.sh

# Run the script
./start.sh
```
